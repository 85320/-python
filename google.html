<h2> Introduction</h2>
A computer nees step-by-step instruction  to complete a task. these instruction are called a<br>
computer program when they are written in some programming language . But before they are <br>
written in any programming language, these steps are written in simple english language. these are<br>
calle Algorithims.<br>

these instruction are written in a language which the computer understands and this language is <br>
known as programming language . there are many programming languages which you may already <br>
have use like BASIC, C++, visual basic etc . in this chapter you will learn a new programinglanguage<br>
called as Python. scared ? dont't be , as it is an easy to learn and use programming language which<br>
 you will enjoy using !

<ol start type= "1" type="1"><b>
<li> It is easy to learn an use as it has simple structure an syntax.</li>
<li> It is an interactive language which uses an interpreter.</li>
<li> It is portable an can be use on difrent platforms like windows, linux, macintosh etc.</li>
<li> it supports GUI programming </li>
<li> It supports object-oriented  programming an can also be integrated with other language <br>
like C, C++,Java etc.</li>
<li> It is an open source language  an hence available freely. </li>
<h2> Installing python </h2>
you can install python from the web site <td><a href="https://www.python.org/#:~:text=Python,Powered%20by%20Herokuhttps://www.python.org/#:~:text=Python,Powered%20by%20Heroku">click here</a></td>
once your files is download follow the instruction to install it.<br>

python shell ca be used in two ways<br>
<ol start type = "1"><b>
<li> interactive mode</li>
<li> script moe</li>
let us learn about both.
<h2> interactive mode</h2>
In the interactive moe you can type the command in the winow an the python interpreter will execute <br>
